# The Code
## There are two python notebooks.
### The first notebook - SVM_PD_Classifier_with_GridSearchCV - contains the code used for Grid Search Process
### The second notebook - SVM_PD_Classifier_with_multiple_models - contains the code for the data processing, 
###             model construction, models' training and testing, and model validation.

# The Data
## The data used is in the data folder.
### Namely parkinsons.data or parkinsons.csv.
### parkinsons.names contain information about the dataset.

# The Results
## The photos for the results are in the results folder.
